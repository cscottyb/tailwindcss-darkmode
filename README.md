## Guide
- Download an extension or a plugin for your browser to inject CSS theme into a website. Stylus is Recommend.
- Target the dark mode theme only for the documentation, instead of the whole domain: https://tailwindcss.com/docs. 

## Modification
- You can change the hue (theme color) by changing the `--hue` variable by changing the value.
- You can change the background darkness by switching from --black to, `--dark` or `--dim`. 

## Goals
- provide users a minimally reliabl,e dark CSS theme file to override the documentation portion of the website.
- Provide support to older Tailwind CSS version currently used for production.
- Create stylesheets for all active versions of Tailwind CSS
- Easier to quicker processing of pull requests. 
- Easy for uses to change theme color.
- Be obsolete when the offical dark mode is release. 

## Pull Request Rules
- Quick to test.
- Short; focus on a single feature per pull request. 
- Breif explaination of change.

## How can you help
- Be patient with the Tailwind CSS team as they develop the dark mode theme.
- Provide constructive critisms for this project.
- Direct all financial support to Tailwind CSS maintainers for providing this framework at no cost.

## Future development
- Provide themes base on each color in the color palette for each release version as options within each file.
